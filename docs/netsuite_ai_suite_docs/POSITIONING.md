# Positioning & Moat
_Last updated: 2026-02-15_

## Core positioning
Visibility-first, audit-grade reconciliation and governed NetSuite change management for ecommerce finance.

## Primary differentiator: Table-view visibility
Many integration stacks focus on “flows ran” rather than:
- a unified table drill-down for payouts ↔ postings ↔ discrepancies
- explainable evidence packs tied to close workflows
This product makes tables and drill-down the default interface, with AI as an accelerator.

## Moat pillars
1) Visibility workflow moat: table-first UI + saved views + evidence packs
2) Trust moat: approvals, idempotency, immutable audit trail
3) Domain workflow moat: variance taxonomy + reconciliation playbooks
4) Distribution moat: NetSuite bundle/SuiteApp to reduce friction
5) Admin change-management moat: CRs with impact, rollback, test plan

## Why governance matters (defensibility)
Tool-gated AI + approvals + idempotent writeback builds trust and reduces risk.

## Moat additions
- **AI-assisted reconciliation** that remains explainable and produces evidence packs.
- **Account-aware and subsidiary-aware** configuration captured at onboarding.
- **Customer-controlled posting policy** with audit-grade evidence attachment.
